1) Installation of Optional Components

 In some versions certain components are included separately to the OS.
 To install these optional components, connect the netBook to your PC in
 the usual manner, extract each SIS file from the zip file (for the exact
 procedure please see the instructions with your zip application).
 Open the SIS file to automatically load the application onto the netBook.
 Should you have problems with the above, verify the following:
  The netBook is turned on.
  PsiWin is installed correctly.
  The netBook is correctly connected to the PC.
 Alternatively, the SIS files may be copied directly to the netBook
 (using PsiWin) and opened from there.
